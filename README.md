# Wordle_game

Python code for Wordle game using tkinter.
words.txt is from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt 

Download both files, put them in the same folder. 
Run the python file with command : python WORDLE.py

What my code can do: 
  It's not perfect. 
  As far as I know, it follows the game rules.
  You can use backspace button your keyboard to go back to prev box.
  Enter to check your guess.
  

Game rules :
  1. You have to guess the Wordle in six goes or less
  2. Every word you enter must be in the word list. There are more than 10,000 words in this list, but only 2,309 (at the time of writing) are answers to a specific puzzle
  3. A correct letter turns green
  4. A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow
  5. An incorrect letter turns gray
  6. Letters can be used more than once
